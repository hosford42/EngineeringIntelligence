* **A Formal Definition of Intelligence**: A formalization of the ideas
  proposed in "An Informal Definition Of Intelligence".
* **How to Construct a Mind**: How do we implement a system that models 
  the environment directly (as opposed to modeling it indirectly via 
  emulating natural language as GPT-3 does)?

  general intelligence system.
