## Introduction

This project is an original work, detailing a novel theory of 
intelligence, which I call the Correspondence Theory of
Intelligence, or CToI. Its purpose is to clearly define 
intelligence in such a way that the design requirements for a 
working general intelligence (or human-level intelligence, if 
you prefer) can be specified in sufficient detail and clarity 
to implement an initial working implementation and appropriate 
measures of performance. I am just starting the conversation. 
I will attempt to begin from an initial, informal concept of 
what intelligence is and does, and move gradually towards a
clear, formal mathematical definition. I hope you will find 
the conversation fascinating enough to join in.


## Contributing

I welcome feedback and debate. Please open an issue if you 
wish to contribute. Suggest modifications, point out flaws,
ask for additional features, and submit pull requests... Almost
anything you might do with a software application can be
applied similarly to an informal or formal definition. I 
will attempt to keep issues open until all participants are
satisfied with the conclusion, provided I believe they are
opened in good faith.

Just please remember: **This is an *engineering* approach 
to general intelligence.** Woo, fantasy, and other 
ungrounded quasi-reasoning is not appropriate content for 
this venue. By all means, imagine and project when
things are too abstract or ill-defined to be concrete, but
do it for the purpose of *making* things well-defined and
concrete. We are not here to debate whether it's possible,
whether it will have a soul, or whether it will be humanity's
savior or destroyer. We are here to make it possible and ensure
that it works safely, effectively, and as intended.
