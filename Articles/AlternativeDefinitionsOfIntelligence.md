# Alternative Definitions of Intelligence

A list of definitions of intelligence proposed by third parties. These are
included to provide counterpoint and perspective. Ideally, each of these
should be demonstrated either to be a narrow facet or alternative framing 
of the definition provided in this project, or else to be fundamentally
flawed or otherwise irrelevant.

## Quoted Definitions

* [Miriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intelligence):
  * "The ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying 
    situations."
  * "The ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment or to
    think abstractly as measured by objective criteria."
  * "The act of understanding."
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence):
  * Main article:
    * "The capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, 
      learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity,
      critical thinking, and problem-solving."
    * "The ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as 
      knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an 
      environment or context."
    * "Intelligence enables humans to remember descriptions of things and 
      use those descriptions in future behaviors. It is a cognitive process. 
      It gives humans the cognitive abilities to learn, form concepts, 
      understand, and reason, including the capacities to recognize patterns, 
      innovate, plan, solve problems, and employ language to communicate. 
      Intelligence enables humans to experience and think."
  * "Mainstream Science on Intelligence" (1994):
    * "A very general mental capacity that, among other things, involves the
      ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend
      complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience...a broader and
      deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings -- 'catching on',
      'making sense' of things, or 'figuring out' what to do."
  * Alfred Binet:
    * "Judgment, otherwise called 'good sense', 'practical sense', 
      'initiative', the faculty of adapting one's self to circumstances ... 
      auto-critique."
  * David Wechsler:
    * "The aggregate or global capacity of the individual to act purposefully,
      to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment."
  * Lloyd Humphreys:
    * "...the resultant of the process of acquiring, storing in memory, 
      retrieving, combining, comparing, and using in new contexts information 
      and conceptual skills"
  * Howard Gardner:
    * "..a human intellectual competence must entail a set of skills of problem 
      solving...and must also entail the potential for finding or creating 
      problems — and thereby laying the groundwork for the acquisition of new 
      knowledge."
  * Linda Gottfredson: 
    * "The ability to deal with cognitive complexity."
  * Robert Sternberg & William Salter:
    * "Goal-directed adaptive behavior."
  * Reuven Feuerstein:
    * "The theory of Structural Cognitive Modifiability describes intelligence as
      'the unique propensity of human beings to change or modify the structure of
      their cognitive functioning to adapt to the changing demands of a life
      situation'."
  * Shane Legg & Marcus Hutter:
    * "A synthesis of 70+ definitions from psychology, philosophy, and AI researchers:
      'Intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of
      environments', which has been mathematically formalized."
  * Alexander Wissner-Gross:
    * "Intelligence is a force, F, that acts to as to maximize future freedom of
      action. It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keep options open,
      with some strength T, with the diversity of possible futures, S, up to some
      future time horizon, τ. In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped."
  * Kaplan & Haenlein:
    * "a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such
      data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through
      flexible adaptation"
  * Olle Häggström:
    * "optimization power", an agent's capacity for efficient cross-domain 
      optimization of the world according to the agent's preferences, or more simply 
      the ability to "steer the future into regions of possibility ranked high in a 
      preference ordering"


## Distilled Requirements

Intelligence is:
* A cognitive process
* A general mental capacity

An intelligent system should have the capacity for:
* Abstraction
* Logic
* Self-awareness
* Knowledge
* Creativity
* Judgment/good sense
* Goal-directed adaptive behavior
* Efficient cross-domain optimization of the environment according to its preferences

An intelligent system should be able to:
* Understand situations in the environment
* Understand complex ideas
* Learn quickly
* Learn from experience
* Apply knowledge to manipulate the environment
* Think abstractly as measured by objective criteria
* Correctly interpret external data
* Perceive, acquire, or infer information or conceptual skills
* Retain information as knowledge
* Retrieve information, knowledge, or conceptual skills
* Apply knowledge or conceptual skills towards adaptive behaviors within a (potentially new) 
  environment or context
* Combine information or conceptual skills
* Remember descriptions of things
* Use remembered descriptions of things in future behaviors
* Catch on
* Make sense of things
* Figure out what to do
* Reason
* Plan
* Think
* Solve problems
* Form concepts
* Recognize patterns
* Innovate
* Use language to communicate
* Experience things (i.e. first-person perspective or qualia)
* Take initiative
* Adapt to circumstances
* Self-critique
* Act purposefully
* Deal effectively with the environment
* Find or create problems in order to learn new things
* Deal with cognitive complexity
* Change the structure of its cognitive functioning to adapt to the new situational demands
* Achieve goals in a wide range of environments
* Maximize future freedom of action, or avoid getting trapped
* Steer the future into regions of possibility ranked high in a preference ordering


## Distilled Themes

Intelligence...
* Operates in the abstract domain of data, information, knowledge, concepts, logic,
  descriptions, and patterns. (We will refer to these collectively as "cognitive elements" going 
  forward.)
* Extracts, gathers, and stores cognitive elements from the environment.
* Utilizes cognitive elements it has previously acquired to form conclusions and modulate behaviors.
* Can recombine cognitive elements to construct new cognitive elements.
* Can apply cognitive elements to adapt to novel environments.
* Intentionally modifies its environment, as opposed to merely reacting to it.
* Is context-sensitive.
* Is capable of creativity and innovation.
* Is goal- and preference-directed.
* Is self-aware.
* Is flexible, generic, and effective.
* Is dynamic, adaptive, and capable of learning.
* Is future oriented and makes plans.
* Can use language and communicate.
* Can perform experiments to learn things.
