# Topics for Future Articles

* **CToI's Relationship to CToT**: An exposition on the close
  relationship between the correspondence theory of intelligence and the 
  [correspondence theory of truth (or knowledge)]. Mainly, CToT attempts
  to answer the question, "What is the relationship between truth or
  knowledge and reality?" whereas CToI attempts to answer the question,
  "How can we build a system capable of determining truth or acquiring
  knowledge for itself?" The answers are remarkably similar, but CToI
  begs us to answer in much greater detail and move beyond hypotheticals.
  If CToI allows us to engineer a demonstrably intelligent mind, it will
  lend a lot more credibility to CToT as a valid perspective. Why CToT
  as a starting point for engineering intelligence? Because unlike other
  competing theories, it offers clear mechanisms for implementation.
* **A Formal Definition of Intelligence**: A formalization of the ideas
  proposed in "An Informal Definition Of Intelligence".
* **How to Construct a Mind**: How do we implement a system that models 
  the environment directly (as opposed to modeling it indirectly via 
  emulating natural language as GPT-3 does)?
* **How to Measure Intelligence**: An informal discussion of possible
  ways to assess the presence and performance of intelligence in a 
  general intelligence system.
* **Ways Intelligence Can Fail**: A broad look at general failure modes
  that intelligent systems can experience. A good start might be to look
  over lists of [mental health problems], [cognitive errors], [cognitive
  distortions], [cognitive biases], etc. that human beings can run into.
  (Not all of these will apply to a machine intelligence, of course,
  unless we intentionally design it to emulate us as closely as possible.)
* **Knowledge Graphs as Mental Models**: How to implement a mental model
  as a knowledge graph. Connect this to the existing (currently closed
  source, but expected to be open-sourced) NLU project I've been working
  on as a POC in my spare time over the last decade or so.
