# Topics for Future Articles

* **Alternative Definitions of Intelligence**: A list of other, competing
  definitions of intelligence. These will hopefully each offer some
  kernel of truth or novel perspective which will help to move the
  discussion forward.
* **CToI's Relationship to CToT**: An exposition on the close
  relationship between the correspondence theory of intelligence and the 
  correspondence theory of truth (or knowledge).
* **A Formal Definition of Intelligence**: A formalization of the ideas
  proposed in "An Informal Definition Of Intelligence".
* **How to Construct a Mind**: How do we implement a system that models 
  the environment directly (as opposed to modeling it indirectly via 
  emulating natural language as GPT-3 does)?
* **How to Measure Intelligence**: An informal discussion of possible
  ways to assess the presence and performance of intelligence in a 
  general intelligence system.
