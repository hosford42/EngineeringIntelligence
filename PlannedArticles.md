# Topics for Future Articles

* **CToI's Relationship to CToT**: An exposition on the close
  relationship between the correspondence theory of intelligence and the 
  [correspondence theory of truth (or knowledge)].
* **A Formal Definition of Intelligence**: A formalization of the ideas
  proposed in "An Informal Definition Of Intelligence".
* **How to Construct a Mind**: How do we implement a system that models 
  the environment directly (as opposed to modeling it indirectly via 
  emulating natural language as GPT-3 does)?
* **How to Measure Intelligence**: An informal discussion of possible
  ways to assess the presence and performance of intelligence in a 
  general intelligence system.
* **Ways Intelligence Can Fail**: A broad look at general failure modes
  that intelligent systems can experience. A good start might be to look
  over lists of [mental health problems], [cognitive errors], [cognitive
  distortions], [cognitive biases], etc. that human beings can run into.
  (Not all of these will apply to a machine intelligence, of course,
  unless we intentionally design it to emulate us as closely as possible.)
